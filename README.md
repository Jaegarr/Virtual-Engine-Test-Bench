# ðŸ§ª Virtual Engine Test Bench

A Python-based simulation tool for internal combustion engine (ICE) development.  
This project mimics the real-world process of engine test bench calibration, treating the virtual engine as if it were on a dyno.

It allows performance analysis, fuel efficiency evaluation, and map-based parameter tuningâ€”starting simple and growing in fidelity version by version.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Philosophy

Instead of just building an engine simulator, this project is treated like a real **test engineering campaign**:

- Start with a first-run baseline engine
- Add sensor and control maps incrementally (VE, spark timing, BSFC, boost, etc.)
- Use real test engineer workflows: RPM sweeps, parameter tuning, fault injection
- Evaluate performance, log results, and optimize the engine via simulation

## ðŸ§± Core Components (to be developed)

- **Air Mass Flow Model** based on VE and intake conditions  
- **Torque & Power Calculation** from fuel and spark inputs  
- **Fuel Flow and Efficiency Models** using BSFC maps  
- **Spark Timing and Knock Sensitivity** tuning  
- **Boost & Turbo Modeling** (for later versions)  
- **Interactive Interface** for map tuning and test control  
- **Fault Injection and PID Control** modules
